\title{
Data for barn swallows in Switzerland, 1997-2003
}
\description{
Demographic data of barn swallows (\emph{Hirundo rustica}) were collected from nine sites in Switzerland that were between 19 and 224 km apart from 1997 to 2003.

Each year the number of breeding pairs and detailed information about productivity from regular checks of the nests were recorded. Nestlings were ringed and adults captured, resulting in capture-recapture data. Not all sites were surveyed every year, resulting in NAs in the data.

See Schaub et al. (2015) for details.

\usage{data(swallow)}

\format{
\code{swallow} is a list with 5 components:

\describe{
  \item{marr.j }{an array with mark-recapture data for juvenile females in m-array format, sites x release year x recapture year.}
  \item{marr.a }{an array with mark-recapture data for adult females in m-array format, sites x release year x recapture year.}
  \item{counts }{a matrix with annual number of breeding pairs observed at each site, sites x years.}
  \item{productivity }{an array with productivity variables for monitored broods, brood type (first or second) x sites x years x variable; the variables are total number of eggs and fledglings in monitored broods and the number of broods monitored.}
  \item{second }{an array with the number of first broods and second broods observed, sites x years x brood type.}
