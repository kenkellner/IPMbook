\title{
Data for woodchat shrike from Germany, 1964-1992
}
\description{
Real data for the woodchat shrike (\emph{Lanius senator}) were collected from 1964 to 1992 from a study area in southern Germany.

They comprise the annual number of breeding pairs, information about productivity from regular checks of nests, and capture, ringing and resighting of juvenile and adult shrikes. In some years, no resighting data were collected.

  \item{count }{the annual number of breeding pairs found in the study area.}
  \item{f }{the number fledglings (male or female) produced by 365 broods monitored.}
  \item{d }{d = 0 if \code{f} is an accurate count, d = 1 if it is a lower bound.}
  \item{year }{the year the brood was monitored.}
