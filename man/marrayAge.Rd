\title{
Create age-dependent m-arrays
}
\description{
Convert single-state capture-recapture data to age-dependent m-arrays.
}
\usage{
marrayAge(ch, age, mAge = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ch}{
An individuals x time matrix with capture histories (0: not captured; 1: captured).
}
  \item{age}{
Vector with the age class at first capture for each individual.
}
  \item{mAge}{
maximal number of age classes for which m-arrays are constructed; ignored if \code{max(age) > mAge}. Only required if the \code{age} vector has fewer age classes than we want to separate (e.g. CH contains only individuals marked as juveniles, and we want 2 age classes).
}

}
\value{
A 3-d array, (years-1) x years x age classes, where element [i, j, k] contains the number of individuals of age class k released in year i and recaptured in year j+1 (by definition no recaptures can occur in year 1). The last column contains the number of individuals released in year i and never recaptured.
