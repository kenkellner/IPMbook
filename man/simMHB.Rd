\title{
Simulate detection and count data with spatial and temporal replication
}
\description{
Function simulates MHB lookalike data. The MHB is the Swiss breeding bird survey that is the source of many classic data sets (e.g. Kéry & Royle, 2016, 2021). This survey was launched in 1999 and for a total of 267 1km2 quadrats laid out in an approximate grid over Switzerland. 2 or 3 surveys are conducted in each breeding season (mid April to early July) on a quadrat-specific, constant route averaging 4-6 km and all birds detected are mapped, thus yielding replicated counts of unmarked individuals.

The data are simulated under the assumptions of a binomial N-mixture model where for \code{lambda} we can specify a log-linear trend over the years and we can account for site-level random effects in both the intercept and the slopes of the log-linear model.

For detection probability we have currently a constant average or a logit-linear trend over the years, with no further heterogeneity.

\usage{
simMHB(nsites = 267, nsurveys = 3, nyears = 25,
    mean.lam = 1, mean.beta = 0.03, sd.lam = c(0.5, 0.05),
    mean.p = 0.6, beta.p = 0.1,
    show.plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{nsites}{
the number of sites included in the survey.
}
  \item{nsurveys}{
the number of replicate surveys at each site in each year.
}
  \item{nyears}{
The number of years.
}
  \item{mean.lam}{
intercept of expected abundance.
}
  \item{mean.beta}{
average slope of log(lambda) on year.
}
  \item{sd.lam}{
a length 2 vector, the SDs of the Normal distribution from which random site effects for the intercept and the slope in the log-linear model for lambda are drawn randomly.
}
  \item{mean.p}{
value of constant detection probability per survey (or intercept of the logit-linear model for p).
}
  \item{beta.p}{
slope of the logit(p) in year.
}
  \item{show.plot}{
if TRUE, the output will be displayed graphically.
}
}
\value{
A list with the arguments used and the following components:

 \item{alpha }{vector with intercept used for the log-linear model for lambda for each site}
 \item{beta }{vector with slope used for the log-linear model for lambda for each site}
 \item{lam }{sites x years matrix with the expected number of animals at each site}
 \item{N }{sites x years matrix  with the realized number of animals at each site}
 \item{totalN }{vector with the total number of animals in each year}
 \item{p }{vector with the probability of detection in each year}
 \item{C }{sites x surveys x years array with the counts of animals detected}
