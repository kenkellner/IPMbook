Michael Schaub and Marc KÃ©ry have written a new book on *Integrated Population Models* that was published by Elsevier/Academic Press in December 2021. 

A number of R functions and data sets are needed to complement the code in the book, and these are included in this R package.

Ken Kellner has taken over maintenance of the `IPMbook` package as of August 2023. All issues and pull requests should be submitted to this repository. The original repository is [here](https://github.com/mikemeredith/IPMbook).
