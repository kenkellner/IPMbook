\title{
Converts capture-histories to an m-array for one age class
}
\description{
Creates an m-array for a single- or multistate capture-recapture data with one age class.
}
\usage{
marray(ch, unobs = 0)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ch}{
an individuals x time matrix with single- or multistate capture histories (0: not captured; 1...X: captured in the 1...X states).
}
  \item{unobs}{
number of unobserved states (default is 0, needs to be given only in specific cases).
}

}
\value{
For single-state capture recapture data, an m-array which is a (years-1) x years matrix, where element [i, j] contains the number of individuals released in year i and recaptured in year j+1 (by definition no recaptures can occur in year 1). The last column contains the number of individuals released in year i and never recaptured.

For multi-state capture-recapture data with s states (including potential unobservable states), an m-array which is a (years-1)*s x (years-1)*2 + 1 matrix. An element [i, j] contains the number of individuals released in year t and state n (i = (t-1)*s + n) and recaptured in year k+1 in state m (j = (k-1)*s + m). The last column contains the number of individuals released in year t and state s and never recaptured. The labeling of unobserved states starts with the number of observed states + 1.

# Convert a single state capture history matrix into an m-array
data(woodchat5)
